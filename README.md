# Whiter Arctic Wolves for Planet Zoo 1.6 #

This mod makes the arctic wolf male, female and pup fur whiter, as opposed to the more yellowy shade it is otherwise. Updated to work on Planet Zoo 1.6

I've always loved wolves, particularly white ones, and I noticed that the Planet Zoo arctic wolves as of right now (before the color variation update), have rather yellowy furs. Though common enough, there are also arctic wolves with brighter white furs. So I decided to make this mod, which changes the texture of the arctic wolves to a brighter white shade (The male will have a slightly darker shade of white and the female a bright white).
So if you ever wished for whiter arctic wolves in Planet Zoo, this mod is for you :D 
Now updated for Planet Zoo 1.6

Note: the color variation update in Planet Zoo does not come with separate textures, so the wolves will be using the base one (color variation seems to be given by parameters). Arctic wolves, by default following this update have subtle variation, so this mod will also have some very slight variation in wolves (images shown still apply).  

## **How to install:** ##
-Backup original folders from ```steamapps\common\Planet Zoo\win64\ovldata\Content1\Animals\Dogs\Arctic_Wolf```   and place them somewhere you can find them. 
-Unzip the folders in this mod and add the ones you wish to the ```Arctic Wolf``` folder from your Planet Zoo `Content1` folder, overwriting existing files if prompted. 
-Done! Enjoy! :) 

If you'd like only one wolf to be replaced, the male, female or juvenile, you can download just the file you want.

_**I update my mods within the first three days of a Planet Zoo update. If that doesn't happen it means I don't have internet and will update as soon as I get it. 
Please do not update my mods. I will do it myself. Do not repost or reupload my mods.**_
